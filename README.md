**Our project is a simple maze game.**

1. GAME-DESCRIPTION
 2. The player has to navigate through a labyrinth of walls <sup>(without hitting them)</sup>.
    Every level is representated by the whole screen-size. Once a level is completed the 
    screen is going to reset and a new level will be 'printed'.

1. GAME-INTERACTION
 1. The user is going to interact through fixed keys on the keyboard. The player is <sup>(constantly)</sup> moving so 
    the only thing the user has influence on is the direction. ~~When the player hits a wall the game is over.~~

3. GAME-DESIGN
 1. The game design will be simple. Walls will be turquoise and the player will be grey.
 2. We will build a "level designer" which will generate random levels at the end of this project.
